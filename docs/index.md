- **Cookie Management**: Persistent cookie storage with security features

### Streaming Capabilities
- **Memory-efficient streaming** for large files and continuous data
- **Chunked reading** with configurable chunk sizes
- **Progress tracking** with real-time callbacks
- **Async file I/O** using aiofiles for non-blocking operations
- **Download resumption** and file size limits

### Content Processing
- **Multiple content types**: JSON, HTML, text, raw bytes

## üì¶ Quick Installation

=== "Using pip"

    ```bash
    pip install web-fetch
    ```

=== "From source"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AstroAir/web-fetch.git
    cd web-fetch
    pip install -e .
    ```

=== "With all features"

    ```bash
    pip install web-fetch[all-crawlers,mcp,caching]
    ```

## üîß Quick Start

### Simple URL Fetching

```python
import asyncio
from web_fetch import fetch_url, ContentType

async def main():
    # Fetch as JSON
    result = await fetch_url("https://httpbin.org/json", ContentType.JSON)
    if result.is_success:
        print(f"Status: {result.status_code}")
        print(f"Content: {result.content}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Batch Fetching

```python
import asyncio
from web_fetch import fetch_urls, ContentType

async def main():
    urls = [
        "https://httpbin.org/get",
        "https://httpbin.org/json",
        "https://httpbin.org/html"
    ]

    result = await fetch_urls(urls, ContentType.TEXT)
    print(f"Success rate: {result.success_rate:.1f}%")
    print(f"Total time: {result.total_time:.2f}s")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Streaming Downloads

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from web_fetch import download_file, ProgressInfo

def progress_callback(progress: ProgressInfo):
    if progress.total_bytes:
        percentage = progress.percentage or 0
        print(f"Progress: {percentage:.1f}% ({progress.speed_human})")

async def main():
    result = await download_file(
        url="https://httpbin.org/bytes/1048576",  # 1MB test file
        output_path=Path("downloads/large_file.bin"),
        chunk_size=8192,
        progress_callback=progress_callback
    )

    if result.is_success:
        print(f"Downloaded {result.bytes_downloaded:,} bytes")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface

WebFetch includes a powerful CLI for quick web fetching:

```bash
# Simple URL fetch
web-fetch https://httpbin.org/json

# Fetch as JSON with custom timeout
web-fetch -t json --timeout 30 https://httpbin.org/json

# Batch fetch from file
web-fetch --batch urls.txt --concurrent 5

# POST request with data
web-fetch --method POST --data '{"key":"value"}' https://httpbin.org/post
```

!!! tip "Enhanced CLI"
    The CLI includes rich formatting with colors, progress bars, and tables. Install with `pip install rich>=13.0.0` for the best experience.
